# ASV Benchmarks for CSP
"""
Benchmark suites for csp using airspeed velocity (ASV).

This package contains benchmark suites organized by component:
- bench_core: Core graph execution and node overhead
- bench_stats: Statistics module benchmarks
- bench_baselib: Base library operations
- bench_math: Math operations and accumulators

Note: The benchmark modules are imported lazily by ASV, not at package import time.
